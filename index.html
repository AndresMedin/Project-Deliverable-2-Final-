            <p2>
                Hello, I'm Andres Medina, a current student at the University of Missouri—Kansas City (UMKC), where I'm pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. My academic journey also includes an Associate's degree in Computer Engineering, which laid the groundwork for my ongoing studies and future aspirations.

                At UMKC, my academic endeavors are not just confined to the classroom; they're an exploration of the vast and ever-evolving field of computer science. I actively engage with complex concepts, from software development to advanced programming, always aiming to apply this knowledge in practical, real-world contexts.
                
                My professional path is driven by a deep-seated passion for software development and entrepreneurship. With the skills and insights gained from my education, I am laying the foundation to start my own software company. This venture isn't just about launching a business—it's about creating innovative software solutions that can have a tangible impact in the tech world.
                
                Apart from my studies, I am deeply committed to personal growth and professional development. My goal is to emerge not just as a graduate but as a visionary in the field of technology, ready to contribute novel ideas and solutions. Ultimately, I aspire to use my expertise in computer science and software development to make a significant mark in the industry, perhaps even revolutionizing how we interact with technology in our daily lives.
